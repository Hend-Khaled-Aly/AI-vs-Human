# AI vs Human: An NLP Project

This repository hosts the **AI vs Human** project, created as a capstone for the **Machine Learning for Data Analysis** track under the **Digital Egypt Youth** initiative. The project investigates two advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to distinguish between text written by humans and that generated by AI.

## Project Summary

As AI-generated text becomes increasingly indistinguishable from human writing, the need for reliable detection methods grows. This project tackles that problem by implementing and comparing two key NLP strategies:

1. **Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks (BRNNs)**
2. **Transformer Models**

Two dedicated Jupyter Notebooks are provided, each showcasing the complete pipelineâ€”from data preparation to model training and evaluation.

## Repository Structure

* `BRNNs.ipynb`: Demonstrates the classification approach using Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks.
* `Transformers.ipynb`: Explores the Transformer-based model for identifying AI vs human-written text.

## Highlights

* **Text Preprocessing**: Comprehensive text cleaning and formatting to support model input requirements.
* **Training & Evaluation**: Step-by-step model training with detailed evaluation metrics for comparison.
* **Performance Visualization**: Graphs and plots illustrating model performance (e.g., accuracy, loss).
* **Modular Codebase**: Clean, well-documented code to support easy customization and learning.

## Setup & Dependencies

To run the notebooks and reproduce the results, ensure the following tools and libraries are installed:

* Python 3.7 or higher
* Jupyter Notebook
* Essential Python Libraries:

  * TensorFlow or PyTorch
  * Hugging Face Transformers
  * NumPy
  * Pandas
  * Matplotlib or Seaborn
